✅ **All terminal commands** (like `git clone` or `python etheron_alarm.py`) are **inside code blocks in README.md**, but they are **run in your terminal**, not typed in the README.

The README itself is just a **text/documentation file**.

If you want, I can **write the final polished README.md ready to copy into your repo**. Do you want me to do that?

---

✅ **Summary**:

- **Terminal**: Create the file, stage, commit, push.
- **README.md**: Paste the full content above.

---

If you want, I can **also make a version with badges and a more polished GitHub look**, so your repo looks professional instantly.

Do you want me to do that next?
